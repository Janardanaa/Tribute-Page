            <h3 id="headline"> Here's a time line of Leonardo Dicaprio's Career </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> 1991-1996 </strong> : In 1991, DiCaprio played an un-credited role in one episode of Roseanne.
                </li>
                <li><strong> 1997–2001 </strong> : DiCaprio rejected a role in the film Boogie Nights on 1997 to star opposite Kate Winslet in James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage.
                </li>
                <li><strong> 2002-2009 </strong> : DiCaprio turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002). His first film that year was the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who before his 19th birthday committed check fraud to make millions in the 1960s.
                </li>
                <li><strong> 2010-2013 </strong> : DiCaprio continued to collaborate with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island, based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. 
                </li>
                <li><strong> 2014-Now </strong> : DiCaprio was an executive producer on Virunga, a 2014 British documentary film about four people fighting to protect the world's last mountain gorillas from war and poaching.[163] The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2014. DiCaprio received nomination for a 2015 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special. Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret was another documentary film that year for which he was an executive producer—he took part in the new cut released exclusively on Netflix that September. It explores the impact of animal agriculture on the environment, and investigates the policies of environmental organizations on this issue.

                    "Life can get pretty monotonous. Acting is like living multiple lives. 
                    When you make a movie, you go off to different places, live different cultures, 
                    investigate somebody else's reality, and you try to manifest that to the best 
                    of your ability. It is incredibly eye-opening. That's why I love acting. 
                    There's nothing as transformative as what a film, a documentary, can do to get 
                    people to care about something else besides their own lives."
